        **Climate Change Impact Assessment and Prediction System for Nepal** is a capstone project under the Omdena-NIC 
        Data Science and Machine Learning course. The objective is to analyze the effects of climate change across Nepal 
        using real-world environmental and climatic datasets.

        This dashboard presents key insights from datasets including:
        - Climate indicators (temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.)
        - Environmental data (forest area by district)

        The system aims to support data-driven decisions for sustainable environmental planning and climate resilience in Nepal.
